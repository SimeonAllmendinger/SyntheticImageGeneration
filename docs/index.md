<h3> Navigating the Synthetic Realm: Harnessing Diffusion-based Models for Laparoscopic Image Generation <h3>

<h4>Simeon Allmendinger, Patrick Hemmer, Niklas Kühl, Leopold Müller, Moritz Queisner, Igor Sauer, Michael Vössing </h4>

<p> Recent advances in synthetic imaging open up opportunities for obtaining additional data in the field of surgical imaging. This data can provide reliable supplements supporting the development of Computer Vision enabled surgical applications and simulation purposes. The image-based field of laparoscopy, with its increased robotic applications, benefits particularly strongly from synthetic image datasets and virtual surgical training methods. Our study presents an intuitive approach for generating synthetic laparoscopic images from short text prompts using diffusion-based generative models. We demonstrate the usage of state-of-the-art text-to-image architectures in the context of laparoscopic imaging with regard to cholecystectomy surgery as an example. Results on fidelity and diversity demonstrate that diffusion-based models can acquire knowledge about the style and semantics in the laparoscopic domain. A validation study with a human assessment survey underlines the realistic nature of our synthetic data, as medical personnel detects actual images in a pool with generated images with a false-positive-rate of 60\%. In addition, the investigation of a state-of-the-art Machine Learning model to recognize surgical actions indicates enhanced results when trained with additional generated images of up to 5\%. Overall, the achieved image quality contributes to the usage of computer-generated images in surgical applications and enhances its path to maturity.</p>
